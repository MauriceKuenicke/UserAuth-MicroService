<em>A moon of Saturn named after the nymph who held Odysseus captive on her island in Greek mythology. Most famously known for her role in Homer's epic poem "The Odyssey." When the Greek hero Odysseus became stranded on her island after a shipwreck, Calypso fell in love with him and kept him as her captive for seven years, promising him immortality and eternal youth if he stayed with her. Calypso is often seen as a symbol of temptation and the dangers of the sea, and her story is frequently retold in literature, music, and art.</em> - chatGPT</p>
